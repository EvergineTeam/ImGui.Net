- [cimguzimo](https://github.com/cimgui/cimguizmo)
- [cimplot](https://github.com/cimgui/cimplot)
- [cimnodes](https://github.com/cimgui/cimnodes)

which are c-api wrapper autogenerated from the original github projects:
- [imgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui)
- [imguizmo](https://github.com/cimgui/cimguizmo)
- [implot](https://github.com/cimgui/cimplot)
- [cimnodes](https://github.com/Nelarius/imnodes)
